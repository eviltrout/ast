# A Javascript Performance Puzzle
## @eviltrout
## https://eviltrout.com

# Discourse
* Open Source Forum Software
* Founded in 2012, still under very active development
* Co-Founded with Stack Overflow alum Jeff Atwood (@codinghorror) and Sam Saffron
* Opinionated and Focused
* At least 20k active installations
* You've probably used it!
---
# Our Stack
* Ruby on Rails (REST API)
* Ember.js
* ... and lots of custom stuff
---
# Discourse's Client Performance History
* Been running Ember.js since pre 1.0
* Client performance used to be more challenging
* Most of the time now we don't worry about it as much
---
# Most JS Peformance is Common Sense
* Do less work
* Allocate less things
* Clean up after yourself
---
# Measuring is Hard
* Variance is high between measurements
* Functions are inlined sometimes but not others
* Different optimizations triggered based on browser heuristics
---
# Measuring is Hard (pt. 2)
* Are you measuring time to first paint, navigating around your app? Both?
* Ever noticed some features are slower with the dev tools open?
* The Chrome profiler has come a long way. Use it!
---
# Ember Performance Suite

* Following feedback from Ember core, we created [emberperf.eviltrout.com](http://emberperf.eviltrout.com).
* Each test runs in a new browser window
* Results are stored in `localStorage`
* Eventually led to fixes in v8
---
# Staying in Shape

Example:

```javascript

let a = { name: 'alice', age: 40 };
let b = { name: 'bob', age: 44 };

// good! engines will notice the same shape and optimize property access

```
---
# Staying in Shape (pt 2.)
```javascript

let a = { name: 'alice', age: 40 };
let b = { name: 'bob', age: 44 };
let c = { name: 'daniella', age: 41, favColor: 'yellow' }; // bad!
```

* `c` no longer has the same shape as `a` and `b`
* Property access is now slower
---
# Staying in Shape (pt 3.)
* Whenever possible declare your object shapes in advance
* Don't use object instances to pass data you'll only need in some situations.

```javascript
let user = { id: 123, name: 'tim'  };

function selectUser(u) {
  u.selected = true;
}
```

* `u.selected` now exists on some users but not others.
* `selected` is a concern of the UX not the user. Move that state to a component.

---
# Discourse Early Days - `StringBuffer`
* Components implement a `render(buffer)` method
* Call `buffer.push()` with string content
* Lazy evaluation of string concatenation
* Worked reasonably well, was fast
---
# String vs DOM Templates
* JS Frameworks were divided between String and DOM templates
* Strings were the fastest way of rendering content
  * Eventually surpassed by Virtual DOM techniques (React)
---
# HTMLBars + Glimmer VM
* Ember Team focused on improving rendering performance
* There were some missteps, but eventually things become good!
* The Glimmer VM compiles templates into a series of rendering instructions
  * Instructions can re-render only parts of the template that changes
  * Faster than virtual DOM depending on the workload (no diff step)
---

# We still wanted to go faster!

---
# Our "Hot Path"
* A [post stream](https://meta.discourse.org/t/embedding-a-list-of-discourse-topics-in-another-site/125911) is an infinitely scrolling list of posts
  * A post has a 15+ controls
  * A post has a list of links
* This could easily be 400+ components to initially render
  on large topics with more added as you scrolled
---
# Under the Hood: The Object Model
* Each component is an `@ember/object`
* `@ember/object` instance supports bound data, computed properties and observers
* These are awesome features but they come at a cost
* The more bound data you have, the more work Ember has to
  do to wire up updates and the slower it goes
---
# Crazy Idea
* What if we knew our exact data flow and when re-rendering needed to happen?
* That's where having many years of experience on one project really helps!
* We could trade flexibility and ease of coding for speed
---
# Discourse Widgets
* A lightweight wrapper on the open source [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) library
* Less than 300 LOC
* Replaces Handlebars templates with Javascript classes
* Bubbles actions up into Ember
* Leverages the Ember run loop for coalescing and scheduling updates
---
# Transforming Shape
* Goes through a [transform](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/discourse/lib/transform-post.js.es6) phase, where we take `Topic` and `Posts` heavy objects
  and create new shapes for the render path.
* The new shapes cannot be updated or trigger updates and are read only.
* The render pipeline has the same property each time, which makes a noticeable
  difference in perf.
---
# Major Downside: Uglier and Harder to write

Handlebars
```handlebars
<div class='post'>
  <div class='post-body'>
    {{post.body}}
  </div>
</div>
```

Discourse Widget
```javascript
import { h } from 'virtual-dom';

createWidget('post', {
  tagName: 'div.post',
  html(attrs) {
    return h('div.post-body', attrs.body);
  }
});
```

# What if there was a better way?
<img src="thinking.png">
---
# A Glimmer of hope

* Ember's underpinnings are the Glimmer VM

* Glimmer takes Handlebars templates, and creates an AST
  and eventually a wire format

* Could we leverage this?
---
# Abstract Syntax Trees

* They sound super computer-sciencey and that's scary, but
  they're not that complicated.

* Compiler takes your text file (handlebars) and emits a
  series of objects that represent your program.

* Once it's done that hard part, you can write code that
  goes through the objects and does stuff that you want to do.
---
# Retrieving an AST

```javascript
import PreProcessor from '@glimmer/syntax';

let compiled = PreProcessor.preprocess("hello {{name}}");

{
  type: "Program",
  body: [
    {
      type: 'TextNode',
      chars: 'hello ',
    },
    {
      type: 'MustacheStatement',
      path: {
        type: 'PathExpression',
        original: 'name'
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

# Now that you have a template in Javascript, you can change it!
<img src="smile.png">
---
# Fun Ideas!

* Lint your templates to find untranslated strings

* Replace dynamic content with static content when compiled
  for performance.  (font awesome icons for example)

* The possibilities are endless!
---
# Discourse's Approach

* Retrieve AST from Handlebars template

* Loop through the nodes, run a `switch` statement on the
  type of node, transpile code to target Discourse's
  widget library

* About 250 SLOC total

* Source Code: [lib/javascripts/widget-hbs-compiler.js.es6](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/lib/javascripts/widget-hbs-compiler.js.es6)

# Internals

Input:

```hbs
hello <span>{{attrs.name}}</span>
```

Output:

```javascript
function(attrs, state) {
  var _r = [];
  _r.push("hello ");
  var _a0 = [];
  _a0.push(attrs.name)
  _r.push(virtualDom.h('span', _a0));
  return _r;
}
```

---
# Usage Example

```javascript
createWidget('post-link-arrow', {
  tagName: 'div.post-link-arrow',

  template: hbs`
    {{#if attrs.above}}
      <a class="post-info arrow" title={{i18n "topic.jump_reply_up"}}>
        {{d-icon "arrow-up"}}
      </a>
    {{else}}
      <a class="post-info arrow" title={{i18n "topic.jump_reply_down"}}>
        {{d-icon "arrow-down"}}
      </a>
    {{/if}}
  `
});
```
---
# Success!

* We leverage Ember's code and compiler

* Our developers don't need to learn a new way to write templates

* It's very fast

* It gives us an upgrade path to pure Ember in the future
---
# VMs are just fancy case statements

* Don't be afraid of leveraging them

* I'm a compsci dropout. If I can do this anyone can!

* Build up your toolbox

* Learn your program's flow and identify the hot path
